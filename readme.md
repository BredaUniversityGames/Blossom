### Running the Project

In order to run the engine, the startup project must be set to `game`.
The project is setup to run with the editor on ``x64 Debug`` and ``x64 Edit`` configurations (the latter also building with optimizations).

Adjust `game` properties:
- Working Directory to ``$(SolutionDir)bee_engine`` on PC

### Controls

move - 'w' 'a' 's' 'd' / left stick

look - mouse / right stick

switch camera mode - 'e' / square

That's it. Have fun flying around the beautiful fields of the demo level!
